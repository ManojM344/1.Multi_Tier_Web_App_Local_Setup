# Project-1: Multi Tier Web Application Setup Locally

Before you start automating something, it's crucial to learn how to do it by hand first. This helps you understand it better and find any problems or ways to make it better. When you're good at doing it manually, you can then make it automatic, and it will work better in the end.

In this project, I have given all the resources to setup Multi Tier Web Application stack:
  1. Manually
  2. Automated

* Prerequisites
  - Oracle VM Virtual Box
  - Git bash
  - Vagrant
  - JDK 11 
  - Maven 3 
  - MySQL 8
  - Tomcat
  - MySQL
  - Memcached
  - Rabbitmq

* Database - Here, we used Mysql DB 
  - /src/main/resources/db_backup.sql
  - db_backup.sql file is a mysql dump file. We have to import this dump to mysql db server
  - > mysql -u <user_name> -p<password> accounts < db_backup.sql

# Application Stack Architecture
![Architecture](images/Vprofile%20projectsetup%20Manual.png)
  - Tomcat: Serves as the web server to host the Java-based application.
  - MySQL: A relational database for storing user data securely.
  - Nginx: Acts as a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple application instances.
  - Memcached: Provides caching capabilities for improved performance.
  - RabbitMQ: Used for queuing and messaging between various application components.

# Manual Setup
--------------------------------------------------
* Application stack setup
  - The detailed setup steps are in the AppStackSetup.txt file. Go through the steps and execute it one by one.
  - Path -> vagrant/Manual_provisioning/AppStackSetup.txt


--------------------------------------------------
# Automated Setup
--------------------------------------------------

* VM SETUP
  1. Clone source code.
  2. cd into the repository.
  3. cd into vagrant/Automated_provisioning
  4. Bring up vmâ€™s - $ vagrant up
  5. VALIDATION 
      - Login to web01 vm - $ vagrant ssh web01
      - Get the IP address - $ ip addr show
  6. copy the ip address and paste it in browser
  7. Login as admin_vp (username and password both) check the services
